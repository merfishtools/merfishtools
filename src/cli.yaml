about: MERFISHtools implement a Bayesian framework for accurately predicting gene or transcript expression from MERFISH data. On top, differential expression analysis can be performed for two or multiple conditions, including credible intervals for fold change and coefficient of variation, and controlling the expected false discovery rate.

      after_help: |
        This command estimates expressions for each feature (e.g. gene or transcript) in each cell.
        MERFISH data has to be provided at STDIN in tab separated columns:

        cell
        feature

        cell_position_x
        cell_position_y

        Results are provided as PMF (probability mass function) in columns:

        cell
        feature (e.g. gene, rna)
        expression
